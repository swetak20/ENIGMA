# ENIGMA
Encrpyting ciphertext and decoding them according to the famous Enigma machine.

*Currently only encryption of the message according to the Enigma algorithm is implemetned. The 
implementation of decoding them is still in progress*

** This model is not exact clone of enigma, it has a few differences. **

The design of Enigma limits it to the character set 'A'-'Z'.
Lower-case letters and punctuation are not supported.


## ENIGMA HISTORY

The Enigma machine was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I, and 
device used by the German military command to encode strategic messages before and during World War II.
The Enigma code was first broken by the Poles, under the leadership of mathematician Marian Rejewski, 
in the early 1930s. In 1939, with the growing likelihood of a German invasion, the Poles turned their 
information over to the British, who set up a secret code-breaking group known as Ultra, under 
mathematician Alan M. Turing.
